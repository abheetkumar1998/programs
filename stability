Stability in sorting algorithms
Last Updated: 26-09-2019
Stability is mainly important when we have key value pairs with duplicate keys possible (like people names as keys and their details as values). And we wish to sort these objects by keys.

What is it?
A sorting algorithm is said to be stable if two objects with equal keys appear in the same order in sorted output as they appear in the input array to be sorted.

Formally stability may be defined as,
Let A be an array, and let < be a strict weak ordering on the elements of A.
A sorting algorithm is stable if-
i < j\:\:and\:\:A[i]\equiv A[j]\:\:implies\:\:\pi (i) < \pi (j)
where \pi is the sorting permutation ( sorting moves A[i] to position \pi(i) )
Informally, stability means that equivalent elements retain their relative positions, after
